          <p>
            We're a team consisting of 11 passionate cyclists. 9 years ago we
            were going on a trip to one of our favorite places to visit by bike.
            When we arrived, what met us was hundreds of tourist and piles of
            trash.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            It ruined the experience for us, and we came to think about the
            tourists aswell. They all came here because they have seen pictures
            and videos of this beautiful place. This did not look like the
            picture.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            So we came up with this idea, what if we could go on cycling trips
            together, meet other amazing people and show them unbeliveable
            places around Parksville, While picking up trash.

        <section class="about-section about2">
          <p>
            We spent some time trying to gather equipment, which was expensive.
            One day we got approached by the leaders of the organisation Green
            Canada. They desided to fund us 100% with some of the donations the
            organisation recieved.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            We were over the moon with happiness. We could now bring a bunch of
            people with us on these amazing trips and at the same time, save a
            little bit of nature on the way.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            We change our routes every 6 months, to make sure that we pick up
            trash from different places while still visiting the awesome
            locations.
